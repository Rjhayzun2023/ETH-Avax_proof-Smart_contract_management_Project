# Starter Next/Hardhat Project

Inside the gitpod, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/

Addionally:

1. Make your hardhat port public to access `https://8545-metacrafterc-scmstarter-msotxik1s10.ws-us104.gitpod.io` for the RPC url.
2. Set up your metamask: make sure you have the account 0 as an account, you should also make a new net work using the RPC url above.
3. Once set up you can run your code and try my codes.
